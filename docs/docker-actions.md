# Docker Actions
This repo of OpenWhisk serverless uses a custom Docker image as the action runtime. We have the OpenWhisk platform dynamically inject the source files into the custom runtime during initialization.

## Creating Custom Docker Image & Register in Docker Hub

We build our own custom Docker image for our various python applications (i.e., `matmul`, `image-process`). The Dockerfile and the libraries to bake into the image are located in `python3-openwhisk-docker`. Below is the series of commands we use to build the image and register it in Docker Hub. 

- Build the Docker image (in `python3-openwhisk-docker`)
```console
$ docker build -t python3-ow .
```
- Tag the Docker image with Docker Hub Username
```console
$ docker tag python3-ow psinha25/python3-ow
```
- Push the Docker image to Docker Hub
```console
$ docker push psinha25/pyhon3-ow
```

Note that you might run into a the following issue upon trying to push:
```console
$ docker push psinha25/python3-ow
Using default tag: latest
The push refers to repository [docker.io/psinha25/python3-ow]

```
You need to login on the command line:
```console
$ docker login -u "psinha25" --password-stdin "<password>" docker.io
```
Then retry pushing and it should work.

## Using Docker Images with OpenWhisk Actions

Now that we have our custom Docker image on the public Docker Hub, we can use it as our runtime when registering the action with OpenWhisk.

```console
$ wsk action create matmult matmult.py --docker psinha25/python3-ow --web raw --memory 512
ok: created action matmult
$ wsk action invoke matmult -i -p N 10 -r -v
```
